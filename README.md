Data Analyst Job Market Insights
Overview

This project analyzes the U.S. data job market with a strong focus on Data Analyst roles, using Python to identify which skills are most valuable for securing competitive opportunities based on market demand and salary potential.

Using job posting data sourced from Luke Barousse (2023), the analysis examines job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills to better understand trends shaping the data analytics job landscape.

Key Questions

This project answers the following questions:

Which skills are most in demand across the top data roles?

Which skills are trending for Data Analysts over time?

The three most common data job titles were identified, after which the top skills associated with each role were extracted and analyzed to determine role-specific demand.

Insights

SQL is the most in-demand skill for Data Analysts and Data Scientists, appearing in over half of job postings.

Python is highly valued for Data Scientists (~72%) and Data Engineers (~65%).

Data Engineers more frequently require specialized tools such as AWS, Azure, and Spark, while Data Analysts and Data Scientists rely more on Excel and Tableau.

2. Trending Skills for Data Analysts (2023)

To understand skill trends over time, Data Analyst postings were grouped by month and analyzed to track shifts in demand throughout 2023.

Insights

SQL remains the top skill but declined by ~10 percentage points (≈64% → ≈54%).

Excel declined mid-year, rebounded to ~45% in July/August, and closed near ~40%.

Python and Tableau remained relatively stable at ~30–35%, with Tableau increasing toward year-end.

Power BI showed the lowest demand (~18–23%) but experienced a modest upward trend.

Key Takeaways

Data Analysts should prioritize SQL and Python as core technical skills.

Strong Excel proficiency remains essential.

Tableau adds value for visualization-heavy roles, while Power BI is useful but less dominant.

Skill demand evolves continuously, making ongoing upskilling critical.
